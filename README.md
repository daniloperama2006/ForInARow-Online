# Connect 4 Game (Android Kotlin)
## Overview
Connect 4 is a classic two-player board game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid, with the objective of connecting four of their own discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project is an Android app developed in Kotlin, featuring both Player vs Player and Player vs CPU modes.

## Features
- Interactive Grid: 6x7 grid where players can click on columns to drop their discs.

- Player vs CPU Mode: Play against a simple AI that makes strategic moves.

- Player vs Player Mode: Play against another player on the same device.

- Game State Detection: The game checks for a win or a draw after every move.

- Game Restart: The game allows users to restart after a win or a draw.

- Activity Lifecycle Logging: Track the activity lifecycle (onCreate, onStart, onResume, etc.) using Logcat for debugging.
